# Ubqt-assignment


- I as a user can create to-do items, such as a grocery list.
- I as another user can collaborate in real-time with user - so that we can 
(for example) edit our family shopping-list together
- I as a user can add sub-tasks to my to-do items - so that I could make logical groups of 
tasks and see their overall progress
- I as a user can make infinite nested levels of subtasks.
- I as a user can invite collaborators on to different levels of subtasks without exposing my entire list
- I as a user can be sure that my todos will be persisted so that important information is 
not lost when server restarts.
